The message came from a number that seemed trustworthy, claiming there were some bills I needed to address. It asked me to verify something via a link they provided. The scam incident occurred on April 7, 2025. The SMS was from a number, +6591322047, claiming to be from DBS, stating that I had outstanding bills to settle. It directed me to a link for verification: https://secure-dbs-login.com/verify. The message requested me to verify my identity due to outstanding bills. I was directed to a site that looked like DBS's official page, where I ended up entering my card credentials for verification,  it was legitimate. I provided my card credentials for verification,  it was necessary to settle the outstanding bills. I didn’t realize it was a scam until unauthorized transactions started happening. Yes, I entered my card credentials, which included my card number and expiry date. I didn't realize it was a phishing site. They made it look so similar to the actual bank's site, which is why I trusted it at the moment. No, I didn't have to enter my CVV or PIN specifically, just the card number and expiry date. I thought I was doing the right thing to verify my identity, but it all turned out to be fraudulent. I really wish I had noticed the signs earlier.

4,6,2025-08-07T09:54:45.548456,"Hello, I want to report a scam that happened to me. It started with a call. I think it was someone pretending to be from the government. They used WhatsApp later on. It was pretty alarming. The incident occurred on July 7, 2025. During the call, the person was very convincing, saying something about work permit violations linked to my details. It escalated when they transferred the call to someone else on WhatsApp who claimed to be a police inspector. They instructed me to make a bank transfer for the investigations, which I did due to fear. The phone number they used was +6591197935. I didn't get an email, but the first person called himself James Wong, and the one on WhatsApp identified as Inspector Timothy Lee. I thought they were legitimate at the time. They didn't give me any URLs or links, but they asked me to transfer money to a specific bank account to help with the investigation. The account was labeled as TRUST, with the identifier 28327648. I felt pressured to comply because they said it was urgent. They didn't give me any URLs or links, but they asked me to transfer money to a specific bank account to help with the investigation.

I received the SMS on that date. Yes, the SMS requested that I verify my identity because there were outstanding bills. It provided a link that led me to a webpage that looked like the DBS official site, where I entered my card credentials. I thought it was real at the time. The URL provided in the SMS was https://secure-dbs-login.com/verify. There was no email address associated with the scam, just that SMS message. Yes, after clicking the link, I was led to the fake site where I provided my card details. Subsequently, it resulted in an unauthorized bank transfer of $225.90 to a CITIBANK account, specifically the account number 15594078. Yes, that's correct. The beneficiary bank was CITIBANK, and the account number is 15594078. It was really frustrating to realize what happened after I clicked the link and provided my details.

7,26,2025-08-07T10:40:47.925664,"Hello. I want to report a scam I encountered on Carousell. I came across a listing that seemed legitimate, but I was scammed after making a payment. Yes, the listing was for an iPhone 16 Pro Max. It looked good at first and the seller seemed responsive until I made the payment. The price was $1466.85 for the iPhone. The seller, using the moniker 'alexa83', insisted on full payment upfront, which I thought was normal. Now I realize that was a red flag. All communication was done through Carousell's messaging system. I didn't use any other platform, just Carousell. The moniker I encountered was 'alexa83'. I didn't get a profile link, but that was the name used for the listing and all interactions. The bank transfer was made on June 22, 2025, which was the same day I inquired about the iPhone. Yes, that sounds correct. I appreciate your assistance in reporting this scam. That’s all I recall. Yes, that sounds correct. I appreciate your assistance in reporting this scam.

5,42,2025-08-07T12:42:45.307454,"Hello. I would like to report a recent scam incident that involved phone calls and WhatsApp. It was quite alarming, and I lost a significant amount of money. The person who contacted me claimed to be from the Ministry of Manpower, saying there were violations with workers under my details. It was quite shocking to hear that. The initial caller introduced himself as James Wong. He didn't specify a particular role, but he said he was addressing work permit violations. Later, he transferred the call to someone claiming to be Inspector Timothy Lee from the Singapore Police Force. The phone number I received the call from was +6591197935. They didn't provide an email address during the conversation, just used WhatsApp afterwards for further communication. I lost a total of $39,695.01. It was a lot to lose, especially since I thought I was helping with an investigation. I lost a total of $39,695.01.
