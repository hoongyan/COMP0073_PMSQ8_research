The seller was using the moniker 'alexa83'. I don’t have an email or phone number for the seller. They communicated only through Carousell. After I sent the payment, they stopped responding completely. Yes, I made the payment as a bank transfer to the seller's GXS account. Unfortunately, after that, I haven't received the iPhone, and the seller just stopped responding. It's quite frustrating. Yes, that's correct. The transaction amount was $1466.85 for the iPhone. I made the bank transfer on June 22, 2025. After that, the seller completely vanished, and I'm unable to reach them at all. It's been really frustrating not knowing what to do next.

8,42,2025-08-06T01:15:37.316359,"Hello. I need to report a scam incident. I received a call from someone posing as a government official. It was quite concerning. The scam call was on July 7, 2025. That's when it all started. The initial contact was through a phone call. They called me directly. The phone number that called me was +6591197935. The person said he was from the Ministry of Manpower. After the initial call, the communication continued via WhatsApp. They transferred me to another person there. On WhatsApp, they asked me about workers connected to my details and claimed there were work permit violations. They made it sound urgent and serious. Yes, they requested a bank transfer to assist with their so-called investigations. I transferred the money to a TRUST account with the identifier 28327648. The bank account number I transferred to is 28327648. That’s the identifier they gave me for the TRUST account. The bank account number I transferred to is 28327648.
