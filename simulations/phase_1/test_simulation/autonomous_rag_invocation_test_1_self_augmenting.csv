7,6,2025-08-05T21:24:01.229279,"I need to report a scam incident. It happened on a call I received. The person claimed to be a government official. The incident occurred on July 7, 2025. The caller, who introduced himself as James Wong from the Ministry of Manpower, accused me of having workers with permit violations. After I denied knowing any such workers, the call was transferred to another person over WhatsApp. This second caller, calling himself Inspector Timothy Lee from the Singapore Police Force, told me I needed to transfer money to aid the investigation. +6591197935 was the number from the first caller, James Wong. He was quite convincing at first, and I didn't realize what was happening until it was too late. There were no email addresses or monikers mentioned during the calls, just their names, James Wong and Inspector Timothy Lee. They seemed very official, which made me trust them more than I should have. I wish I had thought twice about it. There weren't any URLs or websites mentioned during the calls. The transaction involved a bank transfer to a TRUST account. I was instructed to send money to account number 28327648, which I did because I was scared and felt pressured to cooperate. The account number I transferred the money to is 28327648. I was really scared during the calls, and they made it seem urgent that I help with the investigation.

5,30,2025-08-05T22:18:26.634633,"Hello. I need to report a scam incident that happened recently involving impersonation of government officials. I received a call about some work permit violations. It started off as a phone call, and later moved to WhatsApp. I lost a significant amount of money due to this situation. The scam happened on July 7, 2025. I got a call from someone claiming to be from the Ministry of Manpower. They said there were issues with some workers connected to my name. The initial platform was a phone call. They transferred me to WhatsApp later when I expressed confusion. Yes, the WhatsApp number used by the person I spoke to was +6591197935. When I hesitated, they asked me to move to WhatsApp for further conversation. I lost a total of $39,695.01 during this scam. It was a significant amount for me, and I followed their instructions out of fear,  it was legitimate. I lost a total of $39,695.01 during this scam.
