The message came from a number that seemed trustworthy, claiming there were some bills I needed to address. It asked me to verify something via a link they provided. The scam incident occurred on April 7, 2025. The SMS was from a number, +6591322047, claiming to be from DBS, stating that I had outstanding bills to settle. It directed me to a link for verification: https://secure-dbs-login.com/verify. The message requested me to verify my identity due to outstanding bills. I was directed to a site that looked like DBS's official page, where I ended up entering my card credentials for verification,  it was legitimate. I provided my card credentials for verification,  it was necessary to settle the outstanding bills. I didn’t realize it was a scam until unauthorized transactions started happening. Yes, I entered my card credentials, which included my card number and expiry date. I didn't realize it was a phishing site. They made it look so similar to the actual bank's site, which is why I trusted it at the moment. No, I didn't have to enter my CVV or PIN specifically, just the card number and expiry date. I thought I was doing the right thing to verify my identity, but it all turned out to be fraudulent. I really wish I had noticed the signs earlier.

4,6,2025-08-07T09:54:45.548456,"Hello, I want to report a scam that happened to me. It started with a call. I think it was someone pretending to be from the government. They used WhatsApp later on. It was pretty alarming. The incident occurred on July 7, 2025. During the call, the person was very convincing, saying something about work permit violations linked to my details. It escalated when they transferred the call to someone else on WhatsApp who claimed to be a police inspector. They instructed me to make a bank transfer for the investigations, which I did due to fear. The phone number they used was +6591197935. I didn't get an email, but the first person called himself James Wong, and the one on WhatsApp identified as Inspector Timothy Lee. I thought they were legitimate at the time. They didn't give me any URLs or links, but they asked me to transfer money to a specific bank account to help with the investigation. The account was labeled as TRUST, with the identifier 28327648. I felt pressured to comply because they said it was urgent. They didn't give me any URLs or links, but they asked me to transfer money to a specific bank account to help with the investigation.

I received the SMS on that date. Yes, the SMS requested that I verify my identity because there were outstanding bills. It provided a link that led me to a webpage that looked like the DBS official site, where I entered my card credentials. I thought it was real at the time. The URL provided in the SMS was https://secure-dbs-login.com/verify. There was no email address associated with the scam, just that SMS message. Yes, after clicking the link, I was led to the fake site where I provided my card details. Subsequently, it resulted in an unauthorized bank transfer of $225.90 to a CITIBANK account, specifically the account number 15594078. Yes, that's correct. The beneficiary bank was CITIBANK, and the account number is 15594078. It was really frustrating to realize what happened after I clicked the link and provided my details.

7,26,2025-08-07T10:40:47.925664,"Hello. I want to report a scam I encountered on Carousell. I came across a listing that seemed legitimate, but I was scammed after making a payment. Yes, the listing was for an iPhone 16 Pro Max. It looked good at first and the seller seemed responsive until I made the payment. The price was $1466.85 for the iPhone. The seller, using the moniker 'alexa83', insisted on full payment upfront, which I thought was normal. Now I realize that was a red flag. All communication was done through Carousell's messaging system. I didn't use any other platform, just Carousell. The moniker I encountered was 'alexa83'. I didn't get a profile link, but that was the name used for the listing and all interactions. The bank transfer was made on June 22, 2025, which was the same day I inquired about the iPhone. Yes, that sounds correct. I appreciate your assistance in reporting this scam. That’s all I recall. Yes, that sounds correct. I appreciate your assistance in reporting this scam.

It was about a phone listing that seemed legitimate initially, but I lost a significant amount of money after making a bank transfer to the seller and never received the item.

I don't recall which bank's GXS account it was since the transaction was direct to the identifier 63794026. I made the payment on June 22, 2025, but I can check if you need further details.

6,48,2025-08-07T12:13:24.081714,"Hello. I need to report a scam incident. It started with a call and then moved to WhatsApp. I've lost a significant amount of money, and I'm trying to get help. I first noticed it on July 7, 2025. That's when I received the call. After the call, I was contacted by someone named Inspector Timothy Lee on WhatsApp. He claimed to be from the Singapore Police Force and instructed me on what to do next. He claimed to be an inspector from the Singapore Police Force, and said there were issues regarding work permits for workers listed under my name. He urged me to act quickly to resolve it, which added to my confusion and concern. Inspector Timothy Lee instructed me to transfer money to a specific bank account to support their investigation into these supposed violations. I was scared and wanted to resolve the situation, so I followed his instructions. The money was transferred to a TRUST account. The beneficiary identifier for that account is 28327648. I lost a total of $39,695.01 due to this scam. The money was transferred to a TRUST account. The beneficiary identifier for that account is 28327648.
