The call was from a person named James Wong, who said he was with the Ministry of Manpower. He mentioned some workers under my details had violations. The communication started with a phone call, and then it transitioned over to WhatsApp when I was connected to someone else, named Inspector Timothy Lee from the Singapore Police Force. Following that, I was instructed to make a bank transfer to support an investigation, which I complied with due to concern over the situation.
