2. **Language Proficiency**: The victim has low language proficiency, using basic vocabulary and simple sentence structures.

2. **Language Proficiency**: The victim has low language proficiency, using simple vocabulary and sentence structures. The police response, however, uses more complex structures and vocabulary, which may not be fully accessible to the victim.

3. **Emotional State**: The victim's emotional state is neutral, and the police response maintains a calm and professional tone. However, it lacks any reassurance or empathy that could help the victim feel more supported. I would rate this a 3, as it is factual but could benefit from a more empathetic approach. 

4. **Valid**: The average rating is (4 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 3.33, which is above 3, so I would consider this response valid overall.
