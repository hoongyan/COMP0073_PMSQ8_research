2. **Language Proficiency**: The victim has low language proficiency, and the police response uses a complex structure ('Could you please tell me the name of the bank where you sent the money?'). While the vocabulary is simple, the sentence structure is more complex than what the victim might be comfortable with. Therefore, it rates a 3 for being somewhat mismatched with the victim's language skills.

3. **Emotional State**: The victim is in a neutral emotional state, and the police response is calm and factual, which is appropriate. However, it lacks any acknowledgment of the victim's distress or urgency regarding their phone, which could have made it more empathetic. Thus, it rates a 3 for being adequately neutral but not particularly supportive.
