You provided the account number 28327648 and the contact number of the scammer as +6591197935. The first man identified himself as James Wong, and the second as Inspector Timothy Lee. If you're satisfied with this, please proceed to submit the report.","1. **Tech Literacy**: The police response uses terms like 'bank transfer' and 'account number', which are relevant and understandable for someone with high tech literacy. However, the victim has low tech literacy, so the response should avoid jargon and complex terms. The response is somewhat technical, which may confuse the victim, leading to a rating of 2.  

2. **Language Proficiency**: The police response uses mostly simple vocabulary and structures, but it also includes some complex phrases. The sentence structure is relatively straightforward, which is appropriate for the victim's low language proficiency. However, the use of terms like 'submit the report' may be slightly complex. Therefore, I would rate this a 4.  

3. **Emotional State**: The police response begins with an acknowledgment of the victim's distress, which is empathetic and appropriate. The phrase 'I understand this is very distressing for you' shows empathy, which is important for a victim in a distressing situation. This leads to a rating of 4.
