He had contacted me using +6595167511.\nHe informed me of suspicious or fraudulent transactions detected in my bank account and asked me to confirm these transactions. \nWhen I denied knowledge of such transactions, the call was transferred to another individual named Inspector James Tan via WhatsApp, claiming to be from the Singapore Police Force. \nThey accused me of involvement in legal investigation and demanded that I transfer my bank funds to a \"safety account\" to assist with the investigations. \nInspector James Tan showed me his warrant card during the process and I believed him. I complied and transferred the funds, resulting in the following transaction:\nA transaction of $3504.68 was made to HSBC account 54969192 on 2025-06-16.\nI later realized I had been scammed when the individuals became uncontactable.
